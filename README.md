Real Time Bus Tracker

Description:
This is a fun interactive experience where when you click you can see multiple stops in between MIT campus and Harvard Campus. This project uses languages like
JavaScript and HTML.

How to Run:
Please click on "Real Time Bus Tracker" once you are directed to the tracker page you will be shown 
      the map of Boston, click on "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" every click you make 
      will show you a different stop.

 Roadmap to future improvments:
 
 I would like to add more stops to addtional universities. I would also like to have the dark background option. My ultimate goal to to have a car image as the marker rather than the blue pin.
